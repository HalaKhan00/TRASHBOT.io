Handling heaps of garbage is the most essential issue of today's era. Improper disposal of garbage has a negative impact on the environment <br>
and contributes to adverse climatic changes. <br>Harmful substances and pollutants are released from the accumulated heaps of garbage. Food  <br>
scraps and organic wastes release methane which contributes to climatic change. Toxic chemicals from improper disposal of electronic waste can  <br>
contaminate soil and water sources which will harm human life. Improper waste management results in filling landfills rapidly, leading to  <br>
deforestation and the destruction of natural habitats. Contaminated soil and water from garbage will affect those who rely on it for their  <br>
survival i.e. plants, animals, and humans. Accumulated heaps of garbage release harmful gases into the air which causes air pollution and  <br>
respiratory problems. The poor air quality will have an effect on human life. Accumulation of garbage in landfills increases global greenhouse  <br>
gas emissions. It is essential to adopt proper waste management practices to mitigate these negative impacts and have a healthier environment.  <br>
This includes reducing waste generation through recycling, properly disposing of segregated waste, efficient waste collection, and raising <br>
public awareness about proper waste management. We will be able to protect the environment, conserve resources and mitigate adverse climatic <br>
changes by managing and disposing of heaps of garbage properly and efficiently. Disposal and recycling of trash is one of the main challenges <br>
of the present era because the garbage is accumulated in landfills. The improper disposal of garbage can result in heaps of rubbish which will <br>
harm the environment.  <br>
The TrashBot bin is an efficient solution to the waste management problem.  TrashBot bin is an automated trash sorter that can segregate the <br>
trash without any error and with an accuracy of 87\% that has been achieved on a trash dataset of seven categories i.e. wood, plastic, glass,  <br>
metal, cardboard, battery, and others. Previously, the process of sorting garbage was carried out manually, which was tedious and perilous <br>
work, since it contained harmful and hazardous wastes which endanger human life. TrashBot bin will fix the problem and prevent the garbage <br>
from turning into heaps. Also, sorted trash is much easier to be disposed of.  TrashBot bin will contain several bins inside it, in which it <br>
will segregate waste into its respective bin. This segregation will prevent the accumulation of garbage in landfills. The segregated waste <br>
will be easily disposed of without contaminating soil, air, and water. The TrashBot application will have several features which facilitate <br>
the customer in proper waste management. The schedule bin feature will allow the user to book a slot of his choice for the collection of  <br>
waste. This will prevent the accumulation of waste in landfills. The user will be notified through the application when the TrashBot bin <br>
will be full. The news feature will keep the user aware of the latest environmental and adverse climatic changes due to heaps of garbage. <br>
This will raise awareness for proper waste management among users. The report generation feature will allow the user to analyze how much  <br>
waste is produced weekly and monthly. This will encourage users to reduce waste generation.
